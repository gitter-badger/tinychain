Tinychain is an all-in-one database + application server with support for blockchains, graphs, tables, and tensors.

Tinychain is early alpha software and is not ready for production use. Many core features are only partially implemented, or not yet available in the public API. The API may change without notice.

If you need a feature which is not yet available, or even not yet planned, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/haydnv/tinychain/discussions)!

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to download the latest release from GitHub here: https://github.com/haydnv/tinychain/releases. Binary releases are currently only available for 64-bit Intel Linux (you should be able to build from source on other architectures, but this has not been tested).

If you use the Rust programming language, you can install Tinychain on any platform by running `cargo install tinychain`.

Try this "Hello, World!" program:

```bash
$ ./tinychain &
# ...
$ curl -G "http://localhost:8702/state/scalar/value/string" --data-urlencode 'key="Hello, world!"'
```

You can find more in-depth examples in the [tests](https://github.com/haydnv/tinychain/tree/master/tests) directory.

## Key features

### Safety

 * **Synchronization**: Tinychain's distributed Paxos algorithm automatically enables cross-service transactions within any set of services which support the Tinychain protocol.
 * **Hypothetical queries**: making changes to a production database is dangerous, particularly when the changes are inherently destructive (like dropping a column from a database table). Tinychain's hypothetical query feature mitigates this risk by allowing the developer to examine the state of their database *as if* a potentially-destructive change had been applied, without actually committing the change.
 * **Data encapsulation**: Tinychain integrates the database layer with the application layer of a cloud service, meaning that data never has to leave the application that authorizes access to it. Also, because Tinychain is a self-contained cloud-native runtime, a Tinychain service can easily be deployed to a user to run on-premises, meaning that the user never has to grant the vendor access to their data.
 * **Memory safety**: Around [70% of serious security bugs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-70-percent-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/) are memory-safety bugs. Tinychain is written in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org), which mitigates this risk by building memory safety into the language itself.

### Performance

 * **Concurrency**: Tinychain **Op**s are automatically executed concurrently, although a developer can use the **After** flow control to modify this behavior.
 * **Hardware acceleration**: The **Tensor** and **Graph** data types support hardware acceleration on CUDA and OpenCL backends, no extra code needed.
 * **Native speed**: The Tinychain runtime itself is written in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/), a systems programming language with native support for memory-safe multithreading and compute performance comparable to C. All user-defined Tinychain classes must extend a native class implemented in Rust so that basic operations will benefit from native speed.
 * **Transactional filesystem cache**: Tinychain's transactional filesystem layer has a built-in memory cache with least-frequently used (LFU) eviction. Every **Chain** and **Collection** is built on top of this transactional filesystem, providing the benefits of in-memory speed for small collections and automatic filesystem cacheing for large collections. This means that, for example, you can write the same code to process a 1MB **Tensor** or a 1TB **Tensor**, without worrying about chunking the data to load it into memory.

### Development velocity

 * **Rapid prototyping**: Set up a REST API for your service in just a few minutes and scale the application to your entire user base without rewriting.
 * **Object orientation**: The Python client allows defining a Tinychain service as a Python package, which can be then be distributed to other developers, who can use the same Python code to interact with your (hosted) service from their own, without writing any boilerplate integration code, or defining two different APIs for internal and external use.
 * **Service mesh**: The Tinychain runtime acts as a service mesh for your Tinychain services, allowing for cross-service debugging and analysis, among other features, no extra integration code needed.
 * **Portability**: A Tinychain service can run in any cloud environment, or be distributed across many heterogenous clients, no Docker or Kubernetes required. A Tinychain developer can also choose make some or all of their service's functionality availble for a client to run on-premises, so that the client never has to give the service vendor access to their customer data.

## Data structures

 * **Cluster**: a collection of **Chain**s and **Op**s responsible for managing consensus relative to other **Cluster**s on the network
 * **Chain**: A record of mutations applied to a subject **Collection**\*\* or **Value**
    * **SyncChain**: A **Chain** with one block, which contains the data necessary to recover from a transaction failure\* (e.g. if the host crashes)
    * **BackupChain**\*: A **Chain** whose blocks are deleted once they reach a certain age, and replaced with a copy of the **Chain**'s subject at that time
    * **BlockChain**\*: A **Chain** with a record of every mutation in the history of its **Collection**\*\* or **Value**
    * **CompliantChain**\*: A **Chain** which retains all history by default, but which allows purging all data owned by a given (anonymous) user ID, for compliance with legal requirements like [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) and [CCPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Consumer_Privacy_Act)
    * **ReduceChain**\*: A **Chain** which defines a reduce method to compress old blocks, useful for metrics (i.e. to reduce per-second statistics to per-minute, per-minute to per-hour, etc.)
 * **Collection**\*\*
    * **BTree**\*\*: A [B-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree), used to index tabular data
    * **Table**\*\*: A database table, which supports one or more **BTree**\*\* indices
    * **Tensor**\*\*: An n-dimensional array of numbers which supports both sparse and dense representations, useful for machine learning applications
    * **Graph**\*: A graph database which uses a sparse **Tensor**\*\* to compute relationships between rows in its **Table**\*\*s
 * **Scalar**
    * **Value**: a generic value type such as a string or number which can be collated and stored in a **BTree**
    * **Ref**: a reference to another value which must be resolved as part of a [**Transaction**](#life-of-a-transaction)
    * **Op**: a user-defined executable function

## The Tinychain protocol

### Data description

Tinychain exposes a JSON API over HTTP, and treats a subset of JSON as a Turing-complete application language. For example, this is a function to convert meters into feet:

```json
{"/state/scalar/op/get": ["to_feet", [
    {"/state/scalar/ref/if": [
        {"$meters/gte": 0},
        {"$meters/mul": 3.28},
        {"/error/bad_request": "Negative distance is not supported"}
    ]}
]]}
```

Obviously writing this by hand gets unwieldy very quickly, which is why a [Python client](https://github.com/haydnv/tinychain/tree/master/client) is provided. Here's the same function defined using the Python client:

```python
@tc.get_op
def to_feet(txn, meters: tc.Number) -> tc.Number:
    return tc.If(
        meters >= 0,
        meters * 3.28,
        tc.error.BadRequest("negative distance is not supported"))
```

You can look in the [tests](https://github.com/haydnv/tinychain/tree/master/tests) directory for more detailed examples.

### Authentication

Tinychain uses recursive JSON web tokens provided by the [rjwt](http://docs.rs/rjwt/) library. Each Tinychain host which handles part of a transaction must validate the auth token of the incoming request, sign it with its own private key, and forward it to any downstream dependencies.

### Life of a transaction

Example:

```
|   user@example.com    |         retailer.com       |             factory.com          |          shipping.com        | bank.com
|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------
| Buy 1 widget for $20 -> Debit user's account $20 -------------------------------------------------------------------->          
|                       | Make 1 widget -------------> Debit retailer's account $10 ----------------------------------->
|                       |                            | Ship 1 widget to user's address -> Debit retailer's account $5 ->          
```

* `user@example.com` initiates the transaction by sending a request to `retailer.com`, with an auth token signed by `example.com` whose scopes limit its use to the intended action
    * `retailer.com` claims ownership of the transaction by creating a new, signed request token which includes the original token
        * `retailer.com` sends a request to `bank.com` to debit $20 from the user's account
        * `retailer.com` sends a request to `factory.com` to manufacture 1 widget
            * `factory.com` sends a request to `bank.com` to debit $10 from `retailer.com`'s account
            * `factory.com` sends a request to `shipping.com` to schedule a shipment to the user's address, and charge `retailer.com`
                * `shipping.com` sends a request to `bank.com` to debit $5 from `retailer.com`'s account

Requests at the same indentation level above are executed concurrently, after validating the incoming request's auth token. If any action fails, the transaction is dropped, and the user receives an error response. Each participant must notify the transaction owner that it is a participant by forwarding the auth token. If all dependencies resolve succeessfully, `retailer.com` (the transaction owner) commits the transaction by sending a commit message to each participant. After it receives an OK response from each participant, it commits its own state and sends an OK response to the user. Acceptance by any service of a request with transaction ID X forbids acceptance of any subsquent request with transaction ID X, unless it is shares the same origin (the same end-user) and is therefore a dependent operation of the same transaction. Acceptance of a request with transaction ID X forbids acceptance of any request with a transaction ID < X.

Note that this is only the case in a mutation (a write transaction). A read-only transaction does not need to perform any explicit synchronization with the transaction owner, only to lock the given transaction ID.

The concurrency control flow of this sequence of operations, starting from transaction number (X - 1) is:
1. Client initiates transaction X
1. Service endpoint validates auth token
1. Service endpoint claims transaction X, becoming the transaction owner
1. Service endpoint executes requested operation
    1. Dependency receives request
    1. Dependency validates auth token
    1. Dependency notifies transaction owner of its participation
    1. Dependency executes requested operation and replies to the transaction owner
1. Transaction owner notifies dependencies of success, updating their latest committed transaction to X
1. Transaction owner updates its latest committed transaction to X
1. Transaction owner replies to the client

This is effectively the classic [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)) algorithm, with two key differences:
 * For a cross-service transaction, 100% consensus is required before the transaction is committed (this differs from a transaction within a single service with multiple replicas\*, where a minimum 50% consensus is required, and non-compliant replicas are removed from the replica set)
 * The "leader" is not a predetermined property of the network, but simply the first **Cluster** to claim ownership of the transaction (in this sense the Tinychain consensus protocol is "distributed" Paxos)

This functionality is implemented automatically for any service using the Tinychain host software.

*Important note*: this cross-service consensus algorithm trusts each service to a) recover from a crash without losing state\*, and b) communicate that it has committed a transaction honestly and correctly. In other words, it is not a new and trustless protocol, but a new formalization of an existing ad-hoc procedure. An application which requires completely trustless transactions, like a distributed cryptocurrency, should use a single replicated\* **Cluster**.
